/*
The ConclaveRoom class handles the actual logic of the papal election. 
    It stores a list of cardinals and uses a loop to simulate voting rounds.
    In each round, every cardinal randomly votes for another one (but not for themselves).
    If a cardinal receives more than half the total votes, theyâ€™re declared Pope. 
    Otherwise, the voting continues until someone wins. 
    I used Javaâ€™s Random class to make the simulation realistic and unpredictable. 
    This class ties together the behavior of individual cardinals with the overall election process.
